# House Price Prediction (Regression Project)

This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, and furnishing status.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to develop a regression model that can accurately estimate house prices using features related to the property and its amenities. The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modeling, evaluation, and prediction steps.

## Steps Followed

### 1. Load Data
- Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

### 2. Rename Columns
- Rename columns to readable and consistent names.

### 3. Handle Categorical Variables
- Map binary 'yes'/'no' to 1/0.
- One-hot encode the 'Furnishing Status' categorical column.

### 4. Remove Outliers
- Detect and remove outliers using the IQR method in numerical columns.

### 5. Feature Scaling
- Apply `StandardScaler` to scale numerical features.

### 6. Split Dataset
- Split the dataset into training and test sets (80%-20%).

### 7. Model Training
- Train a Linear Regression model on training data.

### 8. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model with RMSE and RÂ² score on test data.

### 9. Make Predictions
- Use the trained model to predict house price for new inputs.
